Generate me 30 sets of strings in the form of "xxxyy-OEM-NNNNNNN-zzzzz" where "xxx" is day of the year between 001 and 366 (for example, 192 = 10th of July) and "yy" is the year (for example, 94 = 1994). Your range is from the first day of 1995 to the last day of 2003. "OEM" must remain intact. The "NNNNNNN" segment consists of digits and must start with 2 zeroes. The rest of the numbers can be anything as long as their sum is divisible by 7 with no remainder. The last segment "zzzzz" should consist of random numbers, "z" representing a number.
